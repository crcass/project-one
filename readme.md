### SMU Coding Bootcamp Project One

## Concept
A simple, easy to use website that allows business travelers to find their favorite food, events, & activities without having to sort through pages of reviews or guess blindly.

The basic premise was this: if you have a friend that lives in the city you're visiting and you asked them where to go, you're friend would tell you "go here." We want to be that friend.

## Motivation
There are a good number of people that travel for business, either as a consultant or possibly for a conference, that have no idea where to go in the city they're visiting. With no direction, and no close friends to rely on, these people often live in their hotel room instead of seeing what the city has to offer. We want to lower the barrier for those that want to explore but don't know where to start.

## Design Process
We considered what a business traveler would look for if they were in town for 24 hours and we came up with three main ideas: a great place to eat, something to do, and a way to keep up their exercise/activity routine while on the road.

From there we drew some sktches of how we would want this to look when presented to the user. One of the major considerations was the 'paralysis of choice' when there are too many options. To eliminate this problem, we decided to present the user with only two options in each category. Our goal was to provide the user with a 'tourist' option and a 'local' option.

## Future Development
Future development goals include
* Authentication with Google, Facebook, etc.
* Ability for users to add multiple days to their journey
* Let user add their hotel information to allow a more customized search by location or distance
* Use stored user data to create review process where users can rate us on how well we
